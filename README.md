# NLP-Deep-Learning
I applied different deep learning models to natural language processing. Glove pre-trained data "glove.6B.50d.txt" could not be uploaded because of size limit to upload github but you can download it from "https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/". Also you need to download BERT pretrained "bert-large-uncased".
